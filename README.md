# IPROG-Project

This project is for the course DH2642 Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web, where a website should be created, which incorporates per-user persistence, with a focus on creating good user experience while following the model-view-presenter structure.

## Third party components:

CoreUI, Various Components: https://coreui.io/vue/docs/getting-started/introduction.html

## Setup Instructions:

1. Copy the code contained in the git repository, this can be done in multiple ways explained and these are explained on github.com
2. You must create a firebase project, or rewrite the parts of the project which handles authentication and persistence if you wish to use another provider. It must be set up to allow authentication, which in this case is done using Google provider, and for a real time database using the following rules to match the structure expected of the program.
   "ProjectGroup56": {
   "upvotes":
   {
   //Allows anyone to read upvotes, but only users to update it
   ".read": true,
   ".write": "auth.uid !== null"
   },
   "$uid": {
   //Allows anyone to read any data, but only users change their own data
   ".read": true,
   // or ".read": "auth.uid !== null" for only authenticated users (?)
   ".write": "auth.uid === $uid"
   }
   },

3. Navigate to the Yoda Gaming folder, since this is where the actual application is located, and the application files are stored. The steps 2.X are to be done in this folder.
   3.1. There are a few files which are needed for the program to function.
   3.1.1 Firstly create a file vite.config.js in the Yoda Gaming folder, which will define the vite project and its structure is the same as defined in the project setup.
   3.1.2 Secondly create a file apiConfig.js in the src folder, which will define the api link and key for the RAWG API, you must also generate keys for the API refer to their page for information, https://rawg.io/apidocs#terms.
   3.1.3 Thirdly create a file firebaseConfig.js, this information can be found on the project details for the firebase project created above, or if another provider is used create a config file for that one.
   3.1.4 You must now install npm to the project, in the Yoda Gaming folder, along with coreUI using npm since that is the source for the third party components used in many views.
4. You should now have installed or created the files needed, along with having set up a firebase, or another provider, in order to handle authentication and persistence, and therefore you should only need to run npm run dev to locally host the website, or be able to upload the website to hosting if the provider also allows this, in that case setting up for that depends on the provider user.

## Other comments:

Note that if the program is run locally, multiple windows may cause some issues, specifically with authentication since when one window signs out the auth token will be set to null, but the other windows user located in the model will not be updated, which may cause issues such as not having the permissions to perform writes. This is not an issue for the hosted version, only the locally hosted one since each window uses the same application state.
