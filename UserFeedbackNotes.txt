Problems:

1. Elements in the header jumping around is distracting, and the login status is not entierly clear.
2. Different parts of the UI has different styles, which is distracting for the user.
3. The home page only showing search results is a bit weird, maybe have some additional aspect to it?
4. Having to much empty space in the UI is a waste, and will make other parts smaller and less easily usable, and may be distracting.
5. The search dropdown menu is not very well designed, and the place to press to search is easily missed with the detailed search link below being more noticable.
6. The detailed search UI could be improved, for example the ranges could have a scale of values added, and the search boxes are a bit wide. 
Also similar to dropdown in search not being immediatly noticable. 
7. Yodafy should make changes to the website, nor be removed, since it currently does nothing.
