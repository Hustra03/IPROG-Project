Summative user evaluation notes:

1. Yodafied description does not include spaces following punctuation.
2. Color palette for the site not great, try to implement one, grey on details view not a good choice.
3. Tags + similar in detailed view should not include scroller.
4. Margin left in search results, for game title and similar information.
5. Have a visual rating system, in addition to current numerical, for the rating 1-5, with yoda heads (use icon), either full or half, similar to 5 star ratings on food websites.
6. User likely to try to use enter to search, which has no effect. 
7. Center the detail view image, and move the show screenshot button to either directly below or slightly to the left of the image.
8. Add spinner for detail view API calls, to improve system understandability for user.
9. Clarify playtime, to something like estimated or main story playtime
10. Use specific fonts + bold/italics to seperate different text, such as titles or descriptions
11. Place image directly after title in detail view.
12. Move upvote + total upvotes buttons to either top rigth or bottom rigth of page, since not relevant for the game but rather for the page.
13. Allow non-users to access total upvote numbers, even if they can not make new votes.
14. Style buttons everywhere, currently not done on for example home page or saved pages.
15. Add margin for detailed page to header + view history.
16. Implement view history, as a collapsable component, use differnt color than light blue.
17. Place a version of the icon on the header, left or right of the title, add more margin for buttons in header.
18. Reorder texts in detailed view, such that rating is located alone in the center of the last row. 

2. Use page to find color palette which is readable but also fits page.
3. Make them row-based, or increase size of boxes a bit.
6. Add keyboard listener for enter to search, always active (?)
